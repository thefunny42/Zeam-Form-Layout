================

``zeam.form.layout`` let you embbed a ``zeam.form`` Form inside a
layout created with `megrok.layout`_.

You just have to import ``Form`` from ``zeam.form.layout`` instead of
``zeam.form.base`` to get that feature.

A default template is defined with only the form code inside it, so
you can use directly if you whish.
